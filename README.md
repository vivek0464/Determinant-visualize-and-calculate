![github-small](https://github.com/vivek0464/Determinant-visualize-and-calculate/blob/master/Screenshot%20(1).png)

## Introduction
It is a Visual Basic.Net application to find the determinant of a 3x3 matrix and visualize its working, with formula for the 
same provided in the appication.For those who don't know about matrix determinant,__link to wikipedia__ article has been provided in the application itself.

## Usage
People who want to calculate the determinant of 3x3 matrix can use the application to do the job instantaneouly. Beginners can read the wikipedia article through the link provided and then come to the application to see how matrix determinant is calculated with the help of visualize button.__The application works for only real values__.If input is not in the correct form then a message box pops up on the screen asking to provide correct input.

## Instructions
The application can be used as follows:
__If you are complete beginner,first click on the link provided in the application to read about the matrix determinant.__
1. Fill the __real values__ as input in the cells inside the determinant .
2. If just want to calculate the determinant,click on __calculate button__.
3. If you want to visualize the process also,click on __visualize button__.
4. If at anytime during visualization,you want to pause the process,you can use the __pause button__.
5. To clear all the text boxes, you can use __clear button__.
6. You can click on the __formula button__ to know the formula used to calculate the determinant of the matrix.
7. Output is calculated in front of "=" sign. R1,R2 and R3 represent the rows whereas C1,C2 and C3 represent the columns.

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute to the application to make it more feature rich such as finding the inverse ,rank ,transpose and extending the appication to matrices of size bigger than 3x3.Application can also be extended to complex numbers domain as well.

## Help
For any problem regarding the application, you can directly raise an issue on its official github repository.

## Installation
You can either download and build the project yourself or you can download the .exe file which can directly be used on windows platform from this location -> "Determinant-visualize-and-calculate/Matrix determinent/bin/Debug/
